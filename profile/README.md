## Welcome 🌸
<p>
Serendipiware is a tiny startup based in Greece, founded on October 7, 2024 by a full-stack CS student.

Our mission is to do what we love: create useful, user-friendly, and privacy-respecting software with moral values and ethics. We’re experimenting and learning as we go, on a journey to discover our identity and build something real.

We want to create cool things that are also beneficial to the world, for users like you, with you. ❤️
